I worked on a machine learning project to predict California house prices using a dataset with features like location, number of rooms, and median income. I started by exploring the data through correlation heatmaps, then cleaned and transformed the data by applying logarithms to skewed variables and converting categorical data into numerical format. Then built a linear regression model that achieved a 0.68 R-squared score, meaning it explained 68% of the variation in house prices. Finally, you set up a grid search to optimize a Random Forest model by testing different parameter combinations to potentially improve the predictions. In the end I achieved a score of 0.81 which is significantly better than what we got originally.
